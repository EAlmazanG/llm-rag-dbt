      "\n",
      "2. **Analyze Dependencies and Relationships**: \n",
      "   - Examine upstream and downstream dependencies for each identified model using dbt's lineage graph. Document which models feed into customer-related models and which models derive data from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Field Existence Evaluation**: \n",
      "   - Check the schema of each customer-related model to ensure that all necessary fields (e.g., customer ID, name, contact information) are present and correctly defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Assess Documentation Needs**: \n",
      "   - Review existing documentation for the identified models. Identify gaps in documentation and create or update documentation to clearly describe model purpose, field definitions, and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Performance/Design Considerations**: \n",
      "   - Evaluate if any of the models require optimization for performance. Consider whether changes in model granularity or keys (e.g., introducing unique keys) may enhance performance or facilitate better analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Tests**: \n",
      "   - Review existing tests on customer-related models. Identify any necessary tests to ensure data quality, such as unique key tests or not-null constraints, and implement them if missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **dbt Project Config**: \n",
      "   - Ensure that the dbt configuration files (dbt_project.yml, etc.) reflect appropriate settings for the identified models, including materializations and configurations that might impact performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Code or Logic Generation**: \n",
      "   - If necessary, prepare SQL queries or CTEs that extract relevant customer-related data efficiently. This may also involve creating intermediate models if data transformations are complex.\n",
