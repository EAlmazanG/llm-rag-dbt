# llm-rag-dbt
RAG system for enabling LLM agents to understand dbt project structures. It retrieves context on models, dependencies, and documentation, allowing agents to generate, refine, and modify code step-by-step with project-specific accuracy. This approach reduces hallucinations and improves responses by leveraging the full context of the repository.
