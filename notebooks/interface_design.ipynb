The user also wants this new column to be accessible in the related `customers` model.\\n\\n# Proposed Changes to Secondary Models  \\n## Affected Model: `customers.sql`  \\n### Changes Needed:  \\n1. **Add the \\'overdue\\' Column:** Update the `customers` model to include the newly added \\'overdue\\' column from the `orders` model to ensure its availability for customer analytics.\\n\\n### Code Changes  \\n- Modify the relevant section of the `customers` model to include the \\'overdue\\' column in the selection query:\\n\\n```sql\\nWITH customer_order_count AS (\\n  SELECT \\n      customer_id,\\n      COUNT(order_id) AS order_count,\\n      SUM(CASE WHEN overdue THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS overdue_orders  -- Add the overdue column\\n  FROM {{ ref(\\'orders\\') }}  \\n  GROUP BY customer_id\\n),\\n```\\n\\n### Documentation Changes  \\n- Modify the YAML schema for the `customers` model to include documentation for the new column:\\n```yaml\\nmodels:\\n  - name: customers\\n    description: \"Customer overview data mart, including total order counts and overdue orders.\"\\n    columns:\\n      - name: overdue_orders\\n        description: \"Count of overdue orders associated with each customer.\"\\n```\\n\\n# Dependencies and Context  \\n- **Upstream Dependency:**  \\n  - The `customers` model relies on the `orders` model, which has been updated to include the \\'overdue\\' column. This change ensures that any customer analysis will now account for overdue orders correctly.\\n\\n- **Downstream Dependencies:**  \\n  - Any subsequent models or analytics that depend on the `customers` model will also benefit from the inclusion of this new column, providing enriched customer insights.\\n\\n## Notes  \\n- These changes directly address the need to include the \\'overdue\\' column in the `customers` model, ensuring that customer-related analytics are more complete and reflect any overdue orders correctly.\\n- By maintaining clear and updated documentation, future developers will understand the role of the new column in the context of customer analysis and reporting.
