      "\n",
      "2. **Analyze Upstream and Downstream Dependencies**: \n",
      "   - Review the dependency graph in dbt to map out which models depend on the customer-related models and which models depend on those downstream. This will help in understanding the broader impact of any changes.\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Verify the existence of all relevant fields in the identified models (e.g., `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `email`, etc.). Ensure these fields align with the required queries or transformations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Documentation Needs**: \n",
