      "\n",
      "3. **Field Existence Check**:\n",
      "   - Verify the existence of relevant fields within each identified model. This includes ensuring that required customer attributes (e.g., customer_id, name) are present and correctly formatted.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Documentation Needs**:\n",
      "   - Update model documentation to include insights on the transformations applied to customer data, relationships with other models, and any business logic being implemented. Ensure that this documentation is clear and accessible for future reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dependencies and Relationships**:\n",
      "   - Assess the impact of any changes to these customer-related models on other models that depend on them. Document any potential cascading effects that may arise from modifications to customer-related logic or data flows.\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Evaluate performance implications of the queries or transformations related to customer data. Consider whether additional indices or materializations are required to maintain efficiency in data retrieval and transformations.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Testing Requirements**:\n",
      "   - Define tests for key integrity checks to ensure the correct functioning of customer-related transformations. This may include uniqueness tests on customer IDs or validating certain data quality metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **dbt Project Configuration**:\n",
      "   - Review any adjustments needed in the dbt project configuration. This includes ensuring models are correctly defined in `dbt_project.yml` regarding materialization strategies and ensuring they align with data governance protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Code or Logic Generation**:\n",
      "   - Design the required SQL logic to extract and transform customer data based on these analyses. This may involve crafting SQL CTEs and selecting appropriate fields to accommodate the desired output.\n",
      "\n",
