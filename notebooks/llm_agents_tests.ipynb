This model is relevant because it is sourced from the `raw_orders` data and directly relates to the user’s requirement of adding a new column 'overdue'. The model aggregates order data, including keys and calculations necessary for linking to `customers`, ensuring that 'overdue', which exists in `raw_orders`, can be seamlessly included in the orders available to customers. Given its lineage, it clearly connects upstream to `raw_orders` and downstream to `customers`, fulfilling the need described in the request.\n",

This adjustment will allow the \\'overdue\\' status to be available for downstream dependencies, particularly the `customers` model.\\n\\n### Changes to `orders.sql`\\n\\nWe will follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Modify the CTEs**: Include the `overdue` column in the CTE where we select from the `stg_orders`.\\n2. **Ensure the joined tables are carrying forward the `overdue` column through any necessary transformations.**\\n\\nHere’s the updated code for `orders.sql`:\\n\\n```sql\\nWITH orders AS (\\n  SELECT *\\n  FROM {{ ref(\\'stg_orders\\') }}  -- Source of orders data\\n),\\norder_items AS (\\n  SELECT *\\n  FROM {{ ref(\\'order_items\\') }}\\n),\\norder_items_summary AS (\\n  SELECT order_id,\\n         SUM(supply_cost) AS order_cost,\\n         SUM(product_price) AS order_items_subtotal,\\n         COUNT(order_item_id) AS count_order_items,\\n         SUM(CASE\\n                 WHEN is_food_item THEN 1\\n                 ELSE 0\\n             END) AS count_food_items,\\n         SUM(CASE\\n                 WHEN is_drink_item THEN 1\\n                 ELSE 0\\n             END) AS count_drink_items\\n  FROM order_items\\n  GROUP BY order_id\\n),\\ncompute_booleans AS (\\n  SELECT orders.*,\\n         order_items_summary.order_cost,\\n         order_items_summary.order_items_subtotal,\\n         order_items_summary.count_food_items,\\n         order_items_summary.count_drink_items,\\n         order_items_summary.count_order_items,\\n         order_items_summary.count_food_items > 0 AS is_food_order,\\n         order_items_summary.count_drink_items > 0 AS is_drink_order\\n  FROM orders\\n  LEFT JOIN order_items_summary ON orders.order_id = order_items_summary.order_id\\n),\\ncustomer_order_count AS (\\n  SELECT *,\\n         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY ordered_at ASC) AS customer_order_number\\n  FROM compute_booleans\\n)\\n\\nSELECT *,\\n       orders.overdue  -- Include the overdue column directly from the orders CTE\\nFROM customer_order_count\\n```\\n\\n### Add \\'overdue\\' to the `.yml` file for documentation\\n\\nWe also need to ensure that the new column is documented in the YAML file corresponding to the `orders` model. It is essential for maintaining clarity and documentation standards. Here\\'s the necessary addition to the `.yml` file:\\n\\n```yaml\\nmodels:\\n  - name: orders\\n    description: \"Order overview data mart, offering key details for each order including if it\\'s a customer\\'s first order and a food vs. drink item breakdown. One row per order.\"\\n    columns:\\n      - name: order_id\\n        description: \"The unique key of the orders mart.\"\\n        data_tests: [\\'not_null\\', \\'unique\\']\\n      - name: customer_id\\n        description: \"The foreign key relating to the customer who placed the order.\"\\n        data_tests:\\n          - relationships:\\n              to: \"ref(\\'stg_customers\\')\"\\n              field: customer_id\\n      - name: ordered_at\\n        description: \"The timestamp the order was placed at.\"\\n      - name: order_cost\\n        description: \"The sum of supply expenses to fulfill the order.\"\\n      - name: overdue\\n        description: \"Indicates whether the order is past its due date.\"\\n      - name: is_food_order\\n        description: \"A boolean indicating if this order included any food items.\"\\n      - name: is_drink_order\\n        description: \"A boolean indicating if this order included any drink items.\"\\n```\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe above modifications ensure the `overdue` column is accurately represented in the `orders` model, fulfilling the user\\'s request while maintaining the integrity and performance of the dbt model. In summary, we modified the SQL query in `orders.sql` to include the `overdue` column and updated the `.yml` file for documentation purposes, ensuring our changes align with best practices and documentation standards in the dbt project.\\n  - Solutions and changes that are going to be made to the affected models to maintain consistency and ensure that the changes are well propagated:\\n    Based on the request to add the new column `overdue` to the `orders` model and ensure it is reflected appropriately in downstream dependencies, particularly the `customers` model, the following modifications to the relevant models and their documentation are outlined below:\\n\\n### Affected Model: `customers.sql`\\n\\nSince the `customers` model is downstream of `orders`, we need to ensure that it is adjusted to recognize and utilize the `overdue` column from the `orders` model. Here\\'s how you can include it in the `customers.sql` if we were to aggregate or make use of it:\\n\\n1. **Modify the CTEs or SELECT statements** to incorporate the `overdue` field where needed.\\n\\nHere’s a potential code update for `customers.sql`:\\n\\n```sql\\nWITH customer_orders AS (\\n  SELECT customer_id,\\n         COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,\\n         SUM(order_cost) AS total_order_value,\\n         MAX(ordered_at) AS last_order_date,\\n         SUM(CASE WHEN overdue THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_overdue_orders  -- Count overdue orders\\n  FROM {{ ref(\\'orders\\') }}  -- Set to reference updated orders model\\n  GROUP BY customer_id\\n)\\n\\nSELECT c.customer_id,\\n       c.customer_name,\\n       customer_orders.total_orders,\\n       customer_orders.total_order_value,\\n       customer_orders.last_order_date,\\n       customer_orders.total_overdue_orders,  -- Include the total overdue orders\\n       CASE \\n         WHEN customer_orders.total_overdue_orders > 0 THEN TRUE \\n         ELSE FALSE \\n       END AS has_overdue_orders  -- Flag to indicate if customer has overdue orders\\nFROM {{ ref(\\'stg_customers\\') }} AS c\\nLEFT JOIN customer_orders ON c.customer_id = customer_orders.customer_id\\n```\\n\\n### Update the Documentation for `customers` in the YAML\\n\\nEnsure the change is also documented in the corresponding YAML file for the `customers` model. This is critical for preserving project clarity and adherence to documentation standards.\\n\\nHere’s the necessary addition to the `.yml` file for `customers`:\\n\\n```yaml\\nmodels:\\n  - name: customers\\n    description: \"Customer data mart providing insights on customer orders including any overdue orders.\"\\n    columns:\\n      - name: customer_id\\n        description: \"The unique identifier for the customer.\"\\n        data_tests: [\\'not_null\\', \\'unique\\']\\n      - name: customer_name\\n        description: \"The name of the customer.\"\\n      - name: total_orders\\n        description: \"The total number of orders placed by the customer.\"\\n      - name: total_order_value\\n        description: \"The total monetary value of orders placed by the customer.\"\\n      - name: last_order_date\\n        description: \"The date the last order was placed by the customer.\"\\n      - name: total_overdue_orders\\n        description: \"The total number of overdue orders associated with this customer.\"\\n      - name: has_overdue_orders\\n        description: \"Indicates if the customer has any overdue orders (boolean).\"\\n```\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe changes ensure that the `overdue` information is effectively included in reporting and analytics related to customers in the `customers` model. The modifications made to `customers.sql` facilitate the aggregation of order data, capturing information about overdue orders. Additionally, the `.yml` documentation updates improve transparency and maintain project integrity. This aligns with dbt best practices, allowing the downstream model to properly utilize the newly introduced column in the `orders` model.  \\n\\n- Models affected that must be adjusted:\\n  ```json\\n  {\\n    \"upstream_models\": [\"orders\"],\\n    \"downstream_models\": [\\n      {\\n        \"model_name\": \"customers\",\\n        \"requirement\": [\"add \\'overdue\\' field and relevant aggregations\"]\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n  ```\\n  - Lineage of the dbt project:\\n                   model_name                source  \\\\\\n0           stg_customers  [ecom.raw_customers]   \\n1           stg_locations     [ecom.raw_stores]   \\n2         stg_order_items      [ecom.raw_items]   \\n3              stg_orders     [ecom.raw_orders]   \\n4            stg_products   [ecom.raw_products]   \\n5            stg_supplies   [ecom.raw_supplies]   \\n6               customers                    []   \\n7               locations                    []   \\n8   metricflow_time_spine                    []   \\n9             order_items                    []   \\n10                 orders                    []   \\n11               products                    []   \\n12               supplies                    []   \\n\\n                                        parent_models          children_models  \\n0                                                  []              [customers]  \\n1                                                  []              [locations]  \\n2                                                  []            [order_items]  \\n3                                                  []    [order_items, orders]  \\n4                                                  []  [order_items, products]  \\n5                                                  []  [order_items, supplies]  \\n6                             [stg_customers, orders]                       []  \\n7                                     [stg_locations]                       []  \\n8                                                  []                       []  \\n9   [stg_order_items, stg_orders, stg_products, st...
