      "\n",
      "2. **Analyze Dependencies and Relationships**: \n",
      "   - Examine upstream and downstream dependencies for each identified model using dbt's lineage graph. Document which models feed into customer-related models and which models derive data from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Field Existence Evaluation**: \n",
      "   - Check the schema of each customer-related model to ensure that all necessary fields (e.g., customer ID, name, contact information) are present and correctly defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Assess Documentation Needs**: \n",
      "   - Review existing documentation for the identified models. Identify gaps in documentation and create or update documentation to clearly describe model purpose, field definitions, and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Performance/Design Considerations**: \n",
      "   - Evaluate if any of the models require optimization for performance. Consider whether changes in model granularity or keys (e.g., introducing unique keys) may enhance performance or facilitate better analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Tests**: \n",
      "   - Review existing tests on customer-related models. Identify any necessary tests to ensure data quality, such as unique key tests or not-null constraints, and implement them if missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **dbt Project Config**: \n",
      "   - Ensure that the dbt configuration files (dbt_project.yml, etc.) reflect appropriate settings for the identified models, including materializations and configurations that might impact performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Code or Logic Generation**: \n",
      "   - If necessary, prepare SQL queries or CTEs that extract relevant customer-related data efficiently. This may also involve creating intermediate models if data transformations are complex.\n",

      "(remember the meaning of all the context data: CONTEXT INFO AND METADATA MEANING: - knowledge_type: Specifies whether the resource is about files within the dbt project configuration, or data models used in the pipeline. - name: Name of the file. - path: Path within the repository where the file or resource is located, relative to the project root. - source: The original dataset, from which the model or resource pulls its data. Only for the first layer of the model. - parents: dbt models  that serve as input dependencies for the current model or file. - children: dbt models that depend on this resource as an input for their logic or data processing. - config: Configuration parameters defined in the file, specifying behaviors, sort keys, materialization... - materialized: Indicates how the data model is materialized (e.g., as a table, view, or ephemeral model) in the pipeline. - is_snapshot: Boolean flag that identifies whether the file represents a snapshot dbt model. - model_category: The logical dbt categorization of the model inside the project, such as base, staging, intermediate, marts... - vertical: Business domain or vertical to which the resource belongs, such as e-commerce, finance, supply... - has_tests: Boolean flag indicating if there are tests associated with this resource in the model .yaml file or in the tests folder. - has_select_all_in_last_select: Specifies if the final SQL query in the file uses a SELECT * statement. So all columns of previous CTEs will be consider as output of the model. - has_group_by: Boolean flag indicating if the SQL code includes a GROUP BY clause for aggregating data. - is_filtered: Boolean flag that specifies whether the resource applies filters to its data with WHERE, HAVING, JOIN... - is_source_model: The model uses the source macro to extract the data from the dbt project sources. It belongs to the first layer of all dbt models. - is_seed: Specifies if the resource is a seed file. - is_end_model: Boolean flag identifying if this is a terminal model in the data pipeline, representing the final output. - is_macro: Boolean flag indicating if the file defines a macro, used for reusable logic across the project. It does not count macros ref to call other models or source to connect to sources. - is_test: Indicates whether the file is a test sql definition used for testing purposes of other dbt models. - macros: Name of the macros used in the dbt model if any. It does not count macros ref to call other models or source to connect to sources. - packages: List of external packages or dependencies required for the resource or project functionality. Only not None in the packages.yml\trow. )\n",
      "DETERMINE: - The primary dbt model directly affected (e.g., where a field is added, a modification is made, or information is requested). - Whether upstream models (UP), downstream models (DOWN), or both (ALL) are necessary to handle this request correctly.\n",
      "Consider the following cases: 1. If a new field is added, specify the model where the field will be added and indicate UP for upstream models needed to populate the field. 2. If an existing field is modified, specify the model where the change occurs and indicate DOWN for downstream models affected by the change. 3. If information is requested, specify the model containing the requested information and indicate UP, DOWN, or ALL based on the context of the data needed. 4. If a field or model is removed, specify the model being affected and indicate DOWN for downstream dependencies impacted.\n",
